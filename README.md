Engineer | Coder | Hardware Hacker

Hi, I’m Abdulsalam — an Electronic & Electrical Engineering student at the University of Leeds. I love building real-world systems that combine hardware and software in creative ways.

I’ve coded combat robots for the Robot Fight League, including weapon systems and movement control, blending C++ with microcontroller logic to bring aggressive machines to life. I’ve also worked on autonomous vehicles, simulation rigs at Caterpillar, and custom embedded game consoles.

Tech I enjoy:
🤖 Embedded C++ & MCU Programming
💥 Robotics (Weapon Systems, Motion Control)
🔌 FPGA & Digital Design (Verilog)
🧪 System Simulation & Testing
📐 PCB Design & Rapid Prototyping

Let’s connect and build something powerful.
